# Zombiff 🧟‍♂️ 🕹

## About 

This idea comes from the references we had of the current games, we are based on the famous game "Zombie Tsunami" both the idea and the gameplay, our game is about our main character who is a zombie endless runner side scrolling trying to survive and go eating humans to win brains and coins.

It is a very entertaining and addictive game where depending on the amount of brains you have eaten changes map and difficulty.

The aesthetics is a mixture of pixel art and 2D animations.
